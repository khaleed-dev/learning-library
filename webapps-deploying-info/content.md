# some options for different types of applications and the corresponding deployment methods, classified as easy, medium, or hard:

## If you have a simple HTML, CSS, JavaScript website, you can use:
- Easy: GitHub Pages or other static website hosting services. This method is easy because it does not require any server-side configuration and the hosting service will handle the deployment for you.
- Medium: A cloud provider such as AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage or Azure Blob Storage. This method is a bit more involved, but it will give you more control over the deployment process and allows you to use a custom domain.
- Hard: Deploying to a Virtual Private Server (VPS) or a dedicated server. This method is more complex and requires more technical knowledge, but it gives you the most control over the deployment process.

## If you have a vanilla JavaScript website, and a Node.js Express app on the backend without a database, you can use:

- Easy: Services like Heroku, Now, or Glitch that allow you to deploy your app with just a few clicks. These services will handle the deployment for you, but you may have limited control over the environment.
- Medium: A cloud provider such as AWS or Google Cloud Platform (GCP). This method requires more setup and configuration, but it gives you more control over the environment and allows you to scale your app as needed.
- Hard: Deploying to a VPS or a dedicated server. This method requires more technical knowledge and experience, but it gives you the most control over the deployment process.

## If you have a full-stack application with React on the frontend, Node.js/Express and MongoDB on the backend, you can use:

- Easy: Services like Heroku, Now, or Glitch that allow you to deploy your app with just a few clicks. These services will handle the deployment for you, but you may have limited control over the environment.
- Medium: A cloud provider such as AWS or GCP. This method requires more setup and configuration, but it gives you more control over the environment and allows you to scale your app as needed.
- Hard: Deploying to a VPS or a dedicated server. This method requires more technical knowledge and experience, but it gives you the most control over the deployment process.

__It's also worth mentioning that using containerization technologies like Docker, can make deployment of all the above types of applications easier and more consistent across different environments.__

# what is docker?

Docker is not a place to deploy your application, but it is a tool that can be used to package and distribute your application in a consistent and portable way across different environments.

When you use Docker to create an image of your application, you are essentially creating a portable and self-contained environment that includes everything needed to run your application, including the code, runtime, libraries, environment variables, and config files. This image can then be run as a container on any machine that has Docker installed, regardless of the underlying system architecture. This means that your application will run the same way on your development machine, a test server, or a production server, which improves consistency and reduces the risk of issues arising due to differences in environment.

Once you have your application packaged as a Docker image, you can then deploy it to a variety of places, such as:

- Cloud providers like AWS, GCP, and Azure that offer container orchestration services like Amazon ECS, GKE, and AKS that allow you to deploy and manage your containerized applications on their infrastructure.
- Services like Heroku, Now, or Glitch, that allow you to deploy your containerized applications on their infrastructure.
- Deploying it to your own infrastructure, such as a Virtual Private Server (VPS) or a dedicated server, and use a container orchestration tool like Kubernetes to manage your containers.

In summary, Docker is a tool that allows you to package and distribute your application in a consistent and portable way across different environments, it is not a place to deploy your application, but it helps to make the deployment process more consistent and easier.

# popular now in 2023:
Render, Railway and Cyclic are similar to the options I provided in that they are all platforms that allow you to deploy web applications and services.

Render and Railway are both fully managed platforms-as-a-service (PaaS) that make it easy to deploy, run, and scale web applications. They both support a variety of programming languages and web frameworks, and they also integrate with other services like databases and storage.

Cyclic, on the other hand, is a platform that allows you to deploy web applications and services with a focus on providing a simple and hassle-free experience. Cyclic is a simple, developer-friendly hosting service that aims to make deploying your app easy.

When comparing these services to the options I provided, they are similar in that they all allow you to deploy web applications, but they have different features, pricing plans, and target audiences.

Render, Railway, and Cyclic are relatively new on the market, but they are gaining traction because of their simple and developer-friendly approach, their pricing, and the features they offer. They are also good options for small to medium-sized projects, personal websites or web applications that don't require a lot of customization.

On the other hand, the options I provided like AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Google App Engine, Azure App Service, Firebase Hosting, Vercel and DigitalOcean App Platform are more mature, more robust and offer more features, but they also have more complexity, cost and a steeper learning curve. They are more suited for enterprise-level projects, projects that require scalability and high availability, and projects that need more customization.

Ultimately, it depends on the specific needs of your project, the resources you have available, and your budget. It's important to evaluate each of these
